So after only a few months of using WordPress, I decided to switch to Octopress. This is that obligatory post that every new Octopress user seems to make.

I used WordPress at first because it is by far the most popular blogging platform out there, and was fairly easy to setup with my current hosting provider. I knew about Octopress before I started my WordPress blog but thought it wasn't worth the trouble. I was very wrong.

There's 5 reasons I can think of at the top of my head about why Octopress is so awesome.
* Super quick deployment; no fumbling with FileZilla
``` bash
rake generate
rake deploy
```

It's that easy.
