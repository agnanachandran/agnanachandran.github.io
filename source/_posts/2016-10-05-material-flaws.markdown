I've always had a cursory interest in design (particularly on mobile and web). UI and UX designers have to solve the problem of creating a functional interface that feels natural, looks beautiful, and easy to use. This is by no means an easy problem, in general. Different people have different tastes, different accessibility issues, different use cases for the product, different things they're used to, and different levels of experience with similar products. Web and mobile applications in particular desire the usage of a colour palette and a common set of UI components. Together with other elements of the design of the app, these come together to form the app's [design language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_language); a set of overarching principles used to guide the design of the application.

Different groups have come up with their own (necessarily opinionated) design languages. One of these is Google's [Material Design](https://material.google.com/).
