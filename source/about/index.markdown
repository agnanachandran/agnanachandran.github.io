Hi, I'm Anojh. I'm a 2A software engineering student at the University of Waterloo currently on my co-op term at Pivotal Labs in Toronto, Ontario. My next coop term is in Fall 2014 from September to December. For more detailed info on my projects, check out [my résumé](http://pluszero.ca/resume). 


This is my blog "Things To Think About".

Stuff I talk about and/or like:

- Random spoofs/parodies/satire
- Experiences
- Code
- Idle banter
- Philosophy
- Everything in between

RECIPE acrostic not intended.

P.S.

If you find a mistake; whether factual, grammatical, syntactical, or otherwise; [please let me know](<mailto:anojhgnanachandran@gmail.com>).
